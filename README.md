# X-Ray-Image-Preprocessing-and-Feature-Extraction
This notebook preprocesses leg and hand X-rays, creating augmented splits and extracting feature vectors using Vision Transformer (ViT) and InceptionV3. It includes steps for data augmentation, train/test splits, and saving features in .pkl files for model training in later notebooks.


1_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Vector_Extraction_for_both_Hands_and_Legs.ipy nb: The code Generates augmented split images and the feature vectors for hand and leg dataset.
a. Give relevant paths to the notebook, Create 3 folders for Additional , Output , and Masked datasets for variables, synthetic_folder, masked_synthetic_folder, additional_folder
b. The code will load these 3 folders with relevant image splits.
c. In the fracAtlas folder, a dataset.csv file will be present, point this file to file_path
variable.
d. Give relevant paths to load the feature vectors generated by the code, so that
eventually generated feature vectors can be loaded to the respective paths of the folders. There will be total 6 feature vectors on paths file_path_leg_validation, file_path_leg_test, file_path_leg_train, file_path_hand_validation, file_path_hand_test and file_path_hand_train.
e. Save coordinates_and_rotations dictionary on the given json_path as .pickle file
