1_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Vector_Extraction_for_both_Hands_and_Legs.ipy nb: The code Generates augmented split images and the feature vectors for hand and leg dataset.
a. Give relevant paths to the notebook, Create 3 folders for Additional , Output , and Masked datasets for variables, synthetic_folder, masked_synthetic_folder, additional_folder
b. The code will load these 3 folders with relevant image splits.
c. In the fracAtlas folder, a dataset.csv file will be present, point this file to file_path
variable.
d. Give relevant paths to load the feature vectors generated by the code, so that
eventually generated feature vectors can be loaded to the respective paths of the folders. There will be total 6 feature vectors on paths file_path_leg_validation, file_path_leg_test, file_path_leg_train, file_path_hand_validation, file_path_hand_test and file_path_hand_train.
e. Save coordinates_and_rotations dictionary on the given json_path as .pickle file


2_Leg_Notebook.ipynb: This Notebook is used to train the GRU sequence prediction model and Train the Regression Models. The best Regression model is placed first, following with the image stitching pipeline
a. Give relevant paths to the notebook to the variable file_path (all three). Created feature vectors from the previous code to be loaded in the Output , and Masked datasets.
b. Give Dataset.csv file's path from fracatlas folder to variable file_path_csv.
c. Variable original_folder shall also point to the input_folder path ( the one
combining both the fractured and non fractured x ray images in one folder).
d. Json_path same as before, points to the coordinates_and_rotations.pkl file
loaded from
1_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Vector_Extraction_for_both_Hands_and_Le
gs.pynb.
e. Now run the code, No manual monitoring required, The code will work on preprocessing Leg dataset and creating shuffled dataset for training GRU sequence model and the Regression Model. Eventually the image stitching pipeline to visualize the end results. Following which other tried approaches for the regression model and a "Before and after" stitching and aligning code to visualize the process.
f. Graphs for the models are all included in the last file which is 3_Hand Notebook.ipynb



3_Hand_Notebook.ipynb : This Notebook is used to train the GRU sequence prediction model and Train the Regression Models. The best Regression model is placed first, following with the image stitching pipeline

f. Appendix Graphs for the models are all included in the last which also includes the graphs for the second Leg models.
