# X-Ray-Image-Preprocessing-and-Feature-Extraction
This notebook preprocesses leg and hand X-rays, creating augmented splits and extracting feature vectors using Vision Transformer (ViT) and InceptionV3. It includes steps for data augmentation, train/test splits, and saving features in .pkl files for model training in later notebooks.
